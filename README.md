My Dog Ate My Homework! (MDAMH) is a task manager with a twist. You begin by choosing a pet, who accompanies you as you accomplish various tasks. Win points to customize your pet, but be careful! If you miss a task deadline your pet will be damaged, requiring you to heal your pet. Miss too many tasks and your pet will die :(
