*This is a repository for a group project for CSC207 at UofT.*

Dog Ate My Homework (DAMH) is a task manager with a twist. You begin by choosing a pet, who accompanies you as you accomplish various tasks. Win points to customize your pet, but be careful! If you miss a task deadline your pet will be damaged, requiring you to heal your pet. Miss too many tasks and your pet will die :(

**Note that this project is a work-in-progress in an early stage of development.**
